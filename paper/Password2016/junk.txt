     Abstract. We propose a password manager EpisoPoss that supports
     the generation of strong passwords based on a user's secret episodic mem-
     ories. To use EpisoPass, a user first collects question-answer pairs relat*
 *ed
     to their own episodic memories. Each is registered with several possible
     answers: a single correct answer and multiple fake answers. When the
     user wants to generate a password, EpisoPass shows each question and
     list of possible answers and asks the user to select those that are correc*
 *t.
     EpisoPass then generates a domain-unique password by substituting the
     characters of a seed string based on the selected answers. Through careful
     selection of memories and answers, EpisoPass provides an authentication
     step using memories that are easy to recall, but difficult for others to
     guess. In this way various strong passwords can be easily managed with-
     out the need for the master password or secret device that is otherwise
     required by conventional password managers. Using a browser extension,
     users can use EpisoPass directly on the login page of conventional Web
     services like Facebook, removing the need to type or copy a password
     string.

1  Introduction


Passwords have been used for various Web services and applications for a long
time, and currently the most popular authentication method on the Internet.
Since short passwords are easily guessed by attackers and using the same pass-
word for different services is unsafe, different long passwords should be used
for different services. However, remembering many long passwords is almost im-
possible for ordinary humans. According to a research in 2007, people use 6.5
passwords on 25 Web services on average, and 4.28% of the users forget their
passwords in 3 months[?].
  Since passwords are difficult to handle, various other authentication methods
have_been_proposed._For example, image-based authentication[?][?], biometrics

authentication1, behavior-based authentication[?], and many other authentica-
tion methods have been proposed.
  However, password-based authentication is still the most convenient and
strong method[?], and it is not supposed to get extinct in a short period of
time[?].
  If we have to live with password-based authentication systems, we have
to devise some ways to handle many passwords, and various "password man-
agers" have been proposed [?][?][?][?][?][?][?]. Password managers remember
users' passwords and help them enter passwords on various services. Most pass-
word managers can manage various passwords by asking users to remember a
single "master password" to access the database. Although password managers
are useful, users have to remember the master password or use a special hardware
device for safely handle password managers, and password managers usually run
on limited devices.
  If we don't want to carry any special device for authentication, all the info*
 *r-
mation required for the authentication should be kept in the brain. However, the
biggest problem of brain-based authentication is that users cannot safely keep
memories like long passwords or master password. For this reason, we believe
that it is far better to "generate" something for the authentication, based on
users' episodic memories which they can never forget. We propose a password
manager EpisoPass that generates strong passwords based only on the user's
secret episodic memories that the user can never forget.



1.1  Checking the PDF File


Kindly assure that the Contact Volume Editor is given the name and email
address of the contact author for your paper. The Contact Volume Editor uses
these details to compile a list for our production department at SPS in India.
Once the files have been worked upon, SPS sends a copy of the final pdf of
each paper to its contact author. The contact author is asked to check through
the final pdf to make sure that no errors have crept in during the transfer or
preparation of the files. This should not be seen as an opportunity to update or
copyedit the papers, which is not possible due to time constraints. Only errors
introduced during the preparation of the files will be corrected.
  This round of checking takes place about two weeks after the files have been
sent to the Editorial by the Contact Volume Editor, i.e., roughly seven weeks
before the start of the conference for conference proceedings, or seven weeks
before the volume leaves the printer's, for post-proceedings. If SPS does not
receive a reply from a particular contact author, within the timeframe given,
then it is presumed that the author has found no errors in the paper. The tight
publication schedule of LNCS does not allow SPS to send reminders or search
for alternative email addresses on the Internet.
  In some cases, it is the Contact Volume Editor that checks all the final pdfs.
In such cases, the authors are not involved in the checking phase.

1.2  Additional Information Required by the Volume Editor

If you have more than one surname, please make sure that the Volume Editor
knows how you are to be listed in the author index.



1.3  Copyright Forms

The copyright form may be downloaded from the "For Authors" (Information for
LNCS Authors) section of the LNCS Website: www.springer.com/lncs. Please
send your signed copyright form to the Contact Volume Editor, either as a
scanned pdf or by fax or by courier. One author may sign on behalf of all of the
other authors of a particular paper. Digital signatures are acceptable.



2  Paper Preparation


Springer provides you with a complete integrated LATEX document class (llncs.cl*
 *s)
for multi-author books such as those in the LNCS series. Papers not complying
with the LNCS style will be reformatted. This can lead to an increase in the
overall number of pages. We would therefore urge you not to squash your paper.
  Please always cancel any superfluous definitions that are not actually used
in your text. If you do not, these may conflict with the definitions of the mac*
 *ro
package, causing changes in the structure of the text and leading to numerous
mistakes in the proofs.
  If you wonder what LATEX is and where it can be obtained, see the "La-
TeX project site" (http://www.latex-project.org) and especially the web-
page "How to get it" (http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html) respectively.
  When you use LATEX together with our document class file, llncs.cls, your
text is typeset automatically in Computer Modern Roman (CM) fonts. Please
do not change the preset fonts. If you have to use fonts other than the preset
fonts, kindly submit these with your files.
  Please use the commands \label and \ref for cross-references and the com-
mands \bibitem and \cite for references to the bibliography, to enable us to
create hyperlinks at these places.
  For preparing your figures electronically and integrating them into your
source file we recommend using the standard LATEX graphics or graphicx pack-
age. These provide the \includegraphics command. In general, please refrain
from using the \special command.
  Remember to submit any further style files and fonts you have used together
with your source files.



Headings.  Headings should be capitalized (i.e., nouns, verbs, and all other
words except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions should be set with an ini*
 *tial
capital) and should, with the exception of the title, be aligned to the left. W*
 *ords
joined by a hyphen are subject to a special rule. If the first word can stand a*
 *lone,
the second word should be capitalized.




4     Lecture Notes in Computer Science: Authors' Instructions


  Here are some examples of headings: "Criteria to Disprove Context-Freeness
of Collage Language", "On Correcting the Intrusion of Tracing Non-deterministic
Programs by Software", "A User-Friendly and Extendable Data Distribution
System", "Multi-flip Networks: Parallelizing GenSAT", "Self-determinations of
Man".



Lemmas, Propositions, and Theorems. The numbers accorded to lemmas,
propositions, and theorems, etc. should appear in consecutive order, starting
with Lemma 1, and not, for example, with Lemma 11.



2.1  Figures



For LATEX users, we recommend using the graphics or graphicx package and the
\includegraphics command.
  Please check that the lines in line drawings are not interrupted and are of
a constant width. Grids and details within the figures must be clearly legible
and may not be written one on top of the other. Line drawings should have
a resolution of at least 800 dpi (preferably 1200 dpi). The lettering in figures
should have a height of 2 mm (10-point type). Figures should be numbered and
should have a caption which should always be positioned under the figures, in
contrast to the caption belonging to a table, which should always appear above
the table; this is simply achieved as matter of sequence in your source.
  Please center the figures or your tabular material by using the \centering
declaration. Short captions are centered by default between the margins and
typeset in 9-point type (Fig. 1 shows an example). The distance between text
and figure is preset to be about 8 mm, the distance between figure and caption
about 6 mm.
  To ensure that the reproduction of your illustrations is of a reasonable qual*
 *ity,
we advise against the use of shading. The contrast should be as pronounced as
possible.
  If screenshots are necessary, please make sure that you are happy with the
print quality before you send the files.
  Please define figures (and tables) as floating objects. Please avoid using op-
tional location parameters like "[h]" for "here".



Remark 1. In the printed volumes, illustrations are generally black and white
(halftones), and only in exceptional cases, and if the author is prepared to co*
 *ver
the extra cost for color reproduction, are colored pictures accepted. Colored
pictures are welcome in the electronic version free of charge. If you send colo*
 *red
figures that are to be printed in black and white, please make sure that they
really are legible in black and white. Some colors as well as the contrast of
converted colors show up very poorly when printed in black and white.

Fig. 1. One kernel at xs (dotted kernel) or two kernels at xi and xj (left and *
 *right)
lead to the same summed estimate at xs. This shows a figure consisting of diffe*
 *rent
types of lines. Elements of the figure described in the caption should be set i*
 *n italics,
in parentheses, as shown in this sample caption.




6     Lecture Notes in Computer Science: Authors' Instructions


2.2  Formulas

Displayed equations or formulas are centered and set on a separate line (with an
extra line or halfline space above and below). Displayed expressions should be
numbered for reference. The numbers should be consecutive within each section
or within the contribution, with numbers enclosed in parentheses and set on the
right margin - which is the default if you use the equation environment, e.g.,

                       Z T~                   ~
                _(u) =      1_ -1ou, u+ N*(-u)  dt .             (1)
                        o   2

  Equations should be punctuated in the same way as ordinary text but with
a small space before the end punctuation mark.



2.3  Footnotes

The superscript numeral used to refer to a footnote appears in the text either
directly after the word to be discussed or - in relation to a phrase or a sente*
 *nce -
following the punctuation sign (comma, semicolon, or period). Footnotes should
appear at the bottom of the normal text area, with a line of about 2 cm set
immediately above them.2



2.4  Program Code

Program listings or program commands in the text are normally set in typewriter
font, e.g., CMTT10 or Courier.

Example of a Computer Program

program Inflation (Output)
  {Assuming annual inflation rates of 7%, 8%, and 10%,...
   years};
   const
     MaxYears = 10;
   var
     Year: 0..MaxYears;
     Factor1, Factor2, Factor3: Real;
   begin
     Year := 0;
     Factor1 := 1.0; Factor2 := 1.0; Factor3 := 1.0;
     WriteLn('Year  7% 8% 10%'); WriteLn;
     repeat
       Year := Year + 1;
       Factor1 := Factor1 * 1.07;
_______Factor2_:= Factor2 * 1.08;
 2The footnote numeral is set flush left and the text follows with the usual wo*
 *rd

  spacing.




               Lecture Notes in Computer Science: Authors' Instructions7


       Factor3 := Factor3 * 1.10;
       WriteLn(Year:5,Factor1:7:3,Factor2:7:3,Factor3:7:3)
     until Year = MaxYears
end.
