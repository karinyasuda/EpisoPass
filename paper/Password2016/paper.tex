\begin{abstract}
We propose a password manager {\it EpisoPoss\/} that supports the generation of strong passwords based on a user's secret episodic memories. To use EpisoPass, a user first collects question-answer pairs related to their own episodic memories. Each is registered with several possible answers: a single correct answer and multiple fake answers. When the user wants to generate a password, EpisoPass shows each question and list of possible answers and asks the user to select those that are correct. EpisoPass then generates a domain-unique password by substituting the characters of a seed string based on the selected answers. Through careful selection of memories and answers, EpisoPass provides an authentication step using memories that are easy to recall, but difficult for others to guess. In this way various strong passwords can be easily managed without the need for the master password or secret device that is otherwise required by conventional password managers. Using a browser extension, users can use EpisoPass directly on the login page of conventional Web services like Facebook, removing the need to type or copy a password string.

\section{Introduction}
% Passwordは使われている
% 
% Passwordが辛いのは一般的事実である[?]
%   基本的に強くするには長くしなければならない
%   忘れる
%   覚えられない
%   サービスごとにパスワードは変えるべきである[?] でも無理
%   定期的に更新させられる
% 強いパスワードを頭で覚えて管理するのは不可能
%       特に弱者には
%   パスワード作成アルゴリズムを自力で使っている人もいるがそれは難しい

Passwords have been used for various Web services and applications
for a long time, and currently the most popular authentication method on the Internet.
%
Since short passwords are easily guessed by attackers and
using the same password for different services is unsafe,
different long passwords should be used for different services.
However,
remembering many long passwords is almost impossible for ordinary humans.
%
% According to Flor\^{e}ncio,
According to a research in 2007,
people use 6.5 passwords on 25 Web services on average, and
4.28\% of the users forget their passwords in 3 months\cite{Florencio:2007:LSW:1242572.1242661}.

%また2011年の野村総研の調査によれば、
%一般的なユーザが{\PW}認証を行なうサイトは平均19.4個で、
%利用している{\PW}は平均3.1個であった\cite{野村総研}。
%多数の{\PW}を記憶することが困難であるため、
%多くのユーザが同じ{\PW}を複数サイトで使い回しているのだと思われる。

% People are frequently asked to register a password when
% they try to use a new service.

% もっと別の認証もいろいろ提案されている
%   画像認証[MALASYM][その他いろいろ]
%   
%   特殊ハードのような持ち物を使う方法など[Pico][YubiKey][RSA]
%   生体認証 指紋認証
%   行動からの認証[]
%   位置ベースの認証[SOUPS]
%  完全置き換えはしばらくは不可能だろう

Since passwords are difficult to handle,
various other authentication methods have been proposed.
For example,
image-based authentication\cite{Biddle:2012:GPL:2333112.2333114}\cite{GraphicalPasswords}, 
biometrics authentication\footnote{
  % \textsf{https:{\slash}{\slash}en.wikipedia.org{\slash}wiki{\slash}Biometrics}
  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics}
},
behavior-based authentication\cite{Dandapat:2015:AYD:2702123.2702457}, 
and many other authentication methods have been proposed.

% というのもパスワードには利点があるから[Bonneau]
%   すでに普及
%   KB以外の特殊ハードが要らない
%   アタック方法はいろいろあるし[] 流出もしばしばだが
%     うまく実装したシステム上でうまく使えば安全
%     ハッシュ、ソルト
%     実装が比較的簡単
% なのでパスワードが近い将来死滅するとは考えられない

However,
password-based authentication is still the most
convenient and strong method\cite{Bonnearu:ReplacePasswords},
and it is not supposed to get extinct
in a short period of time\cite{Herley:2009:PSS:1601990.1602010}.

% % なのでパスワードと生きる方法が工夫されている
% %   強いパスワードを考える方法[]
% %     覚える方法が提案されてたり[Bonneau]
% %       万人むけはむり

% パスワードが死滅しないならパスワードと生きる方法が必要である
%   たとえば様々なパスワード管理システム[][][][]の利用がすすめられている
%   しかしマスターパスワードがいったり特殊ハードがいったりする
%   特殊システムがいる場合がある
%   特殊ハードやソフトは利用がどうしても難しい

If we have to live with password-based authentication systems,
we have to devise some ways to handle many passwords, and
various ``password managers'' have been proposed
\cite{OnePassword}%
\cite{Dashlane}%
\cite{ミルパス}%
\cite{LastPass}%
\cite{KeyPass}%
\cite{NortonIDSafe}%
\cite{IDManager}.
%
Password managers remember users' passwords and help them enter
passwords on various services.
%
%{\PW}管理システムは
%ひとつの「マスター{\PW}」を利用して他のすべての{\PW}を管理するもので、
%暗号化されたデータベースに{\PW}を格納するもの%
%
Most password managers can manage various passwords by
asking users to remember a single ``master password'' to access the database.
%
%が多いが、サービス名をもとにマスター{\PW}を変換することによって
%複数の{\PW}を生成するシステム\cite{SuperGenPass}もある。
%両者ともにマスター{\PW}の記憶は必須であり、
%マスター{\PW}を盗まれたり忘れたりする危険がある。
%
Although password managers are useful,
users have to remember the master password
or use a special hardware device
for safely handle password managers, and
password managers usually run on limited devices.

% 読みとることができない脳内情報を利用するという基本手法は良いのだが覚えられないのが問題である
%   だとすると...パスワードを記憶するかわりに、****脳が既に覚えている秘密の記憶からパスワードを生成すればよいはずである***
%   確かな脳内情報を使ってパスワードを利用する必要があるが、
%     沢山の強力なパスワードそのものを覚えることは不可能に近い
%   だとすると、確かな脳内秘密情報からパスワードをGenerateするしかない
%   そこでエピソード記憶を使う
%   秘密の知識からGenerateするとよい
%

If we don't want to carry any special device for authentication,
all the information required for the authentication should be
kept in the brain.
%
However, the biggest problem of brain-based authentication is that
users cannot safely keep memories like long passwords or master password.
For this reason, we believe that
it is far better to ``generate'' something for the authentication,
based on users' episodic memories which they can never forget.
%
% We believe that a password manager should have the following features.
% (1) It should be available on any platform including PCs, smartphones, and the Web.
% (2) Users should not have secret information (e.g. master password) or special device.
% (3) Rely only on the information in the user's brain.
%
We propose a password manager \textit{EpisoPass} that generates strong passwords
based only on the user's secret episodic memories that the user can never forget.


\subsection{Checking the PDF File}

Kindly assure that the Contact Volume Editor is given the name and email
address of the contact author for your paper. The Contact Volume Editor
uses these details to compile a list for our production department at
SPS in India. Once the files have been worked upon, SPS sends a copy of
the final pdf of each paper to its contact author. The contact author is
asked to check through the final pdf to make sure that no errors have
crept in during the transfer or preparation of the files. This should
not be seen as an opportunity to update or copyedit the papers, which is
not possible due to time constraints. Only errors introduced during the
preparation of the files will be corrected.

This round of checking takes place about two weeks after the files have
been sent to the Editorial by the Contact Volume Editor, i.e., roughly
seven weeks before the start of the conference for conference
proceedings, or seven weeks before the volume leaves the printer's, for
post-proceedings. If SPS does not receive a reply from a particular
contact author, within the timeframe given, then it is presumed that the
author has found no errors in the paper. The tight publication schedule
of LNCS does not allow SPS to send reminders or search for alternative
email addresses on the Internet.

In some cases, it is the Contact Volume Editor that checks all the final
pdfs. In such cases, the authors are not involved in the checking phase.

\subsection{Additional Information Required by the Volume Editor}

If you have more than one surname, please make sure that the Volume Editor
knows how you are to be listed in the author index.

\subsection{Copyright Forms}

The copyright form may be downloaded from the ``For Authors"
(Information for LNCS Authors) section of the LNCS Website:
\texttt{www.springer.com/lncs}. Please send your signed copyright form
to the Contact Volume Editor, either as a scanned pdf or by fax or by
courier. One author may sign on behalf of all of the other authors of a
particular paper. Digital signatures are acceptable.

\section{Paper Preparation}

Springer provides you with a complete integrated \LaTeX{} document class
(\texttt{llncs.cls}) for multi-author books such as those in the LNCS
series. Papers not complying with the LNCS style will be reformatted.
This can lead to an increase in the overall number of pages. We would
therefore urge you not to squash your paper.

Please always cancel any superfluous definitions that are
not actually used in your text. If you do not, these may conflict with
the definitions of the macro package, causing changes in the structure
of the text and leading to numerous mistakes in the proofs.

If you wonder what \LaTeX{} is and where it can be obtained, see the
``\textit{LaTeX project site}'' (\url{http://www.latex-project.org})
and especially the webpage ``\textit{How to get it}''
(\url{http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html}) respectively.

When you use \LaTeX\ together with our document class file,
\texttt{llncs.cls},
your text is typeset automatically in Computer Modern Roman (CM) fonts.
Please do
\emph{not} change the preset fonts. If you have to use fonts other
than the preset fonts, kindly submit these with your files.

Please use the commands \verb+\label+ and \verb+\ref+ for
cross-references and the commands \verb+\bibitem+ and \verb+\cite+ for
references to the bibliography, to enable us to create hyperlinks at
these places.

For preparing your figures electronically and integrating them into
your source file we recommend using the standard \LaTeX{} \verb+graphics+ or
\verb+graphicx+ package. These provide the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.
In general, please refrain from using the \verb+\special+ command.

Remember to submit any further style files and
fonts you have used together with your source files.

\subsubsection{Headings.}

Headings should be capitalized
(i.e., nouns, verbs, and all other words
except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions should be set with an
initial capital) and should,
with the exception of the title, be aligned to the left.
Words joined by a hyphen are subject to a special rule. If the first
word can stand alone, the second word should be capitalized.

Here are some examples of headings: ``Criteria to Disprove
Context-Freeness of Collage Language", ``On Correcting the Intrusion of
Tracing Non-deterministic Programs by Software", ``A User-Friendly and
Extendable Data Distribution System", ``Multi-flip Networks:
Parallelizing GenSAT", ``Self-determinations of Man".

\subsubsection{Lemmas, Propositions, and Theorems.}

The numbers accorded to lemmas, propositions, and theorems, etc. should
appear in consecutive order, starting with Lemma 1, and not, for
example, with Lemma 11.

\subsection{Figures}

For \LaTeX\ users, we recommend using the \emph{graphics} or \emph{graphicx}
package and the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.

Please check that the lines in line drawings are not
interrupted and are of a constant width. Grids and details within the
figures must be clearly legible and may not be written one on top of
the other. Line drawings should have a resolution of at least 800 dpi
(preferably 1200 dpi). The lettering in figures should have a height of
2~mm (10-point type). Figures should be numbered and should have a
caption which should always be positioned \emph{under} the figures, in
contrast to the caption belonging to a table, which should always appear
\emph{above} the table; this is simply achieved as matter of sequence in
your source.

Please center the figures or your tabular material by using the \verb+\centering+
declaration. Short captions are centered by default between the margins
and typeset in 9-point type (Fig.~\ref{fig:example} shows an example).
The distance between text and figure is preset to be about 8~mm, the
distance between figure and caption about 6~mm.

To ensure that the reproduction of your illustrations is of a reasonable
quality, we advise against the use of shading. The contrast should be as
pronounced as possible.

If screenshots are necessary, please make sure that you are happy with
the print quality before you send the files.
\begin{figure}

% \includegraphics[height=6.2cm]{eijkel2}
%\includegraphics[height=6.2cm]{figures/429eec261024dc6c85351f51c12f09b4.png}
\includegraphics[width=12cm,bb=0 0 429 386]{figures/429eec261024dc6c85351f51c12f09b4.png}
\caption{One kernel at $x_s$ (\emph{dotted kernel}) or two kernels at
$x_i$ and $x_j$ (\textit{left and right}) lead to the same summed estimate
at $x_s$. This shows a figure consisting of different types of
lines. Elements of the figure described in the caption should be set in
italics, in parentheses, as shown in this sample caption.}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}


Please define figures (and tables) as floating objects. Please avoid
using optional location parameters like ``\verb+[h]+" for ``here".

\paragraph{Remark 1.}

In the printed volumes, illustrations are generally black and white
(halftones), and only in exceptional cases, and if the author is
prepared to cover the extra cost for color reproduction, are colored
pictures accepted. Colored pictures are welcome in the electronic
version free of charge. If you send colored figures that are to be
printed in black and white, please make sure that they really are
legible in black and white. Some colors as well as the contrast of
converted colors show up very poorly when printed in black and white.

\subsection{Formulas}

Displayed equations or formulas are centered and set on a separate
line (with an extra line or halfline space above and below). Displayed
expressions should be numbered for reference. The numbers should be
consecutive within each section or within the contribution,
with numbers enclosed in parentheses and set on the right margin --
which is the default if you use the \emph{equation} environment, e.g.,
\begin{equation}
  \psi (u) = \int_{o}^{T} \left[\frac{1}{2}
  \left(\Lambda_{o}^{-1} u,u\right) + N^{\ast} (-u)\right] dt \;  .
\end{equation}

Equations should be punctuated in the same way as ordinary
text but with a small space before the end punctuation mark.

\subsection{Footnotes}

The superscript numeral used to refer to a footnote appears in the text
either directly after the word to be discussed or -- in relation to a
phrase or a sentence -- following the punctuation sign (comma,
semicolon, or period). Footnotes should appear at the bottom of
the
normal text area, with a line of about 2~cm set
immediately above them.\footnote{The footnote numeral is set flush left
and the text follows with the usual word spacing.}

\subsection{Program Code}

Program listings or program commands in the text are normally set in
typewriter font, e.g., CMTT10 or Courier.

\subsection{Citations}

For citations in the text please use
square brackets and consecutive numbers: \cite{jour}, \cite{lncschap},
\cite{proceeding1} -- provided automatically
by \LaTeX 's \verb|\cite| \dots\verb|\bibitem| mechanism.

\subsection{Page Numbering and Running Heads}

There is no need to include page numbers. If your paper title is too
long to serve as a running head, it will be shortened. Your suggestion
as to how to shorten it would be most welcome.

\section{LNCS Online}

The online version of the volume will be available in LNCS Online.
Members of institutes subscribing to the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series have access to all the pdfs of all the online
publications. Non-subscribers can only read as far as the abstracts. If
they try to go beyond this point, they are automatically asked, whether
they would like to order the pdf, and are given instructions as to how
to do so.

Please note that, if your email address is given in your paper,
it will also be included in the meta data of the online version.

\section{BibTeX Entries}

The correct BibTeX entries for the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
volumes can be found at the following Website shortly after the
publication of the book:
\url{http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/journals/lncs.html}

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments.} The heading should be treated as a
subsubsection heading and should not be assigned a number.

\section{The References Section}\label{references}

In order to permit cross referencing within LNCS-Online, and eventually
between different publishers and their online databases, LNCS will,
from now on, be standardizing the format of the references. This new
feature will increase the visibility of publications and facilitate
academic research considerably. Please base your references on the
examples below. References that don't adhere to this style will be
reformatted by Springer. You should therefore check your references
thoroughly when you receive the final pdf of your paper.
The reference section must be complete. You may not omit references.
Instructions as to where to find a fuller version of the references are
not permissible.

We only accept references written using the latin alphabet. If the title
of the book you are referring to is in Russian or Chinese, then please write
(in Russian) or (in Chinese) at the end of the transcript or translation
of the title.

The following section shows a sample reference list with entries for
journal articles \cite{jour}, an LNCS chapter \cite{lncschap}, a book
\cite{book}, proceedings without editors \cite{proceeding1} and
\cite{proceeding2}, as well as a URL \cite{url}.
Please note that proceedings published in LNCS are not cited with their
full titles, but with their acronyms!
